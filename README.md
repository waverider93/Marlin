Vert's Marlin 2+ 3D Printer Firmware

This is a custom fork based on the latest marlin source.

The primary difference is in ideology, i believe there should be a single configuration file for many if not all 3dprinters 
to promote synergy and a more uniform experience.

This being said i am a marlin developer and do submit my work upstream (vanilla) assuming they wish to accept it, this is my flavor of marlin (chocolate swirl with sprinkles). (Dont attempt to mix upstream files with my fork)

Currently integrated models include Supported Models: :A10(C/CT/D/E3/M/T)/A20(C/CT/D/E3/M/T)/A30(C/CT/D/E3/M/T)/I3PRO(A/B/C/W/X/C/CT/D/E3/M/T)/E180/D200/M201/Ender3/Bear & there variants hundreds of combinations + more will be added.

If you expect this fork to be maintained and technical support for it, I’m going to need your support in return to make it all happen.

Additional features/models/ect integration can be requested and donations are a great motivation, you may also submit pull requests if you would rather code it your self and request it be merged.

License
Marlin is published under the GPL license because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on GitHub, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork. While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
